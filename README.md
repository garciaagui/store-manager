## Description

**21st project** of the [Trybe][trybe-site-url] Web Development course.

This application is a RESTful API designed for managing dropshipping sales, allowing the creation, viewing, deletion, and updating (CRUD) of products and sales. It was developed in Node.js with MySQL database, following the MSC (Model-Service-Controller) architecture.

#### Entities format

The data below are fictitious and used only to exemplify the structure of the database tables.

- A table called `products`, with the following structure:

## How to Run

To run the project, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository;

```
git clone git@github.com:garciaagui/store-manager.git
```

2. Navigate to the root of the project;

```
cd store-manager/
```

> üîò Now, decide whether the project will be run locally or via Docker.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üíΩ Locally</strong></summary>

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed in version 16 or higher. Check out the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for more information.

2. In the project root, install the project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. Set up the environment variables:

- Rename the `.env.example` file (available in the project root) to `.env`;
- Set the variables for your local environment.

4. Create the database with the command below.

```
npm run migration
```

5. Populate the database with the command below.

```
npm run seed
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The `migration.sql` and `seed.sql` files were created and provided by Trybe.

6. To start the server, use one of the commands below.

```
// Command 1 - Needs to be run again in case of code changes
npm run start

// Command 2 - Restarts the server automatically if there are any changes in the code
npm run debug
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üêã Docker</strong></summary>

1. Make sure you have **docker-compose** installed in version 1.29 or higher. Useful links if you need to install or update: [DigitalOcean Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04) and [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/);

2. Start the containers by running the command below. Two containers will be started: `store_manager` (node) and `store_manager_db` (mysql).

```
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the CLI of the `store_manager` container with the command below or open it in VS Code. For the latter, I recommend the Microsoft extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

```
docker exec -it store_manager bash
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è From now on, **ALL** commands (scripts) available in `package.json` (including npm install) must be executed **INSIDE** the `store_manager` container.

4. Install the project's dependencies.

```
npm install
```

5. Create the database with the command below.

```
npm run migration
```

6. Populate the database with the command below.

```
npm run seed
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The `migration.sql` and `seed.sql` files were created and provided by Trybe.

7. To start the server, use one of the commands below.

```
// Command 1 - Needs to be run again in case of code changes
npm run start

// Command 2 - Restarts the server automatically if there are any code changes
npm run debug
```

- For the local test context, follow the steps below.

1. Rename the `.env.example` file (available in the project root) to `.env`;
2. Set the variables for your local environment.
